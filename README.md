# Project 2

This file will detail how to install required software/libraries and run the ODE program

Here's a list:

*Download and install Python 2.7x and 3.x (the latest in each)

*Download and install PyCharm

*Install the following packages in PyCharm console: NumPy, SciPy, and matplotlib code to install libraries (“pip install numpy”,“pip install scipy”, “pip install matplotlib”)

Open file, input ODE function and initial conditions x0, y0, and h value. Then run the program.
